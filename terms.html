                  As applicable, ArtFixPro will provide the Contractor with the
                  required information to schedule the Services at your location
                  on time. The Contractor is accountable for arranging the
                  scheduled services with the Customer. It is important to note
                  that scheduled Service dates may be subject to modification
                  due to factors beyond the Contractor's control, such as
                  inclement weather or other unforeseeable circumstances.

                  As ArtFixPro, we regret to inform you that we do not offer any
                  haul away or moving services. We kindly request that you
                  ensure your item is in the desired room or location before our
                  appointment for assembly or installation. If the appointment
                  must be canceled due to the need for moving services, a
                  cancellation charge will be applied.
                </p>

                  Once the job is completed, our technician is only authorized
                  to dispose of any trash by placing it in your property's
                  designated trash bin. Please note that our technician is not
                  authorized to haul away or remove any trash or packaging

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The customer must ensure that a responsible adult who is at
                  least 18 years of age or older will be present at the
                  residence during the performance of the services. This
                  individual will be authorized by the customer to sign off upon
                  completion of the services.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Our company requires that customers choose the assembly or
                  service location and ensure that all packages, items, or
                  materials are in the designated area. It is the responsibility
                  of the customer to prepare the location in advance of the
                  contractor's arrival.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Please be aware that our contractors are not responsible for
                  moving any package, assembled or mounted item, or any
                  material.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Clearing the way to your desired location is essential to
                  allow the Contractor to safely provide the Services. Please
                  ensure that there are no obstacles, such as furniture or
                  personal belongings, that would impede their path.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  It is requested that the customer does not open the item boxes
                  before the technician arrives. If the customer chooses to do
                  so, the company cannot accept responsibility and liability for
                  any missing or damaged parts. If this occurs after the
                  technician has already visited the property, there will be a
                  $30 travel fee.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In case the customer has any extra service during the
                  appointment or further service requests, claims, or
                  complaints, they are advised to contact Fixtman company in

                  invoice, the Client confirms the completion of the project,
                  hence releases and discharges the Service Provider of refund,
                  dispute, or money-back requests. By accepting this invoice,
                  the Client agrees to pay in full the amount listed in the
                  Total section of the invoice.
                </p>

                  Payment is due at the time of service unless otherwise agreed
                  upon in writing. We accept Debit or credit cards, apple pay,
                  cash app, and PayPal payments. If payment is not received
                  within 3 days of the service date, we reserve the right to
                  assess late fees and interest charges.

              <li>
                <p>
                  At Fixtman, we understand that plans can change, and we strive
                  to provide flexibility for our customers. According to our
                  cancellation policy, you can cancel your scheduled appointment
                  without incurring any penalty if you do so at least 24 hours
                  before the appointment time. However, please note that if you
                  cancel within 24 hours of the appointment, a cancellation fee
                  of $20 will apply. Additionally, if you decide to cancel while
                  the technician is at your location or during the appointment
                  time frame, a $30 fee or a partial service fee will be
                  charged.

                <p>
                  If payment was made before the service and for any reason the
                  service cannot be completed, it is common practice to offer a
                  full refund to the customer. This is generally seen as fair
                  and reasonable, as the customer has not received the service
                  they paid for. Please note that there is no refund after the
                  service has been executed. But, to maintain the quality
                  standards and the benchmarks we have set, we offer our
                  valuable customers a 30-day warranty on all our services.
                  Within 30 days of our service if any issue, arise we'll fix
                  the problem for you with no extra charges.

                to collect the debt, including but not limited to turning the
